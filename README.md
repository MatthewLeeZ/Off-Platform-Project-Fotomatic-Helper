# üì∏ Off-Platform Project: Fotomatic  

## ‚ú® Overview  
This repository is designed to **provide practical help** to anyone working on the **Fotomatic** project from Codecademy. The exercise involves fixing a broken website while adhering to the design specifications. My goal is to share my work to:  
- Assist those who are stuck by highlighting key concepts and solutions.  
- Offer a clear, structured, and organized solution.  
- Gather feedback from the community to improve the code further.  

Additionally, I want to create a collaborative environment where everyone can contribute to refining the solution and resolving inconsistencies frequently reported between the **Visual Design Spec**, and Codecademy's provided solution.  

## üåü Goals of This Repository  
- Help people encountering difficulties with the project.  
- Provide a **structured solution** that aligns with the specifications.  
- Reduce the inconsistencies noted by many users on the Codecademy forum regarding the provided solution.  

## üìù Repository Contents  
1. **HTML Code**: Includes detailed comments explaining the modifications made.  
2. **CSS Code**: Features most of the adjustments, organized and commented in a clear, hierarchical manner:  
   - I: Desktop layout.

   - Follow a clear and consistent method when applying changes.  

2. **Key Concepts to Review Before Starting**  
   The following concepts may be helpful for this project:  
   - Linking the CSS File  
   - Viewport Meta Tag

   - Scaling Background Images  
   - Z-Index  
   - Relative Measurements (e.g., `rem`)  
   - Scaling Images and Videos  
   - Media Queries  
   - Display (`block`, `inline`, `flex`)  
   - Overflow  

3. **Structured Comments**  
   Document your work using a logical and methodical approach. This will make it easier to understand for both you and others who read your code.  

4. **Using Chrome DevTools**  
   Chrome's debugging tools are essential for diagnosing issues in your CSS and experimenting with different rules.
